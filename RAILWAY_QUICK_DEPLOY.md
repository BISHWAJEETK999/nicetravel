# Railway Quick Deploy Instructions

## âœ… What's Fixed
- Build dependencies (Vite now available during Railway build)
- Server binding (`0.0.0.0` for Railway compatibility) 
- Database configuration (automatic PostgreSQL detection)
- Static file serving (files moved from `dist/public/` to `dist/`)

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Railway (3 Steps)

### 1. Add Database
- In Railway dashboard: Add PostgreSQL service
- Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL`

### 2. Set Environment Variables
```
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key
```
(DATABASE_URL is provided automatically)

### 3. Deploy
- Connect GitHub repository
- Railway detects `nixpacks.toml` automatically
- First deployment will build and start your app

## ðŸ“‹ Files That Make It Work
- `nixpacks.toml` - Railway build configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Alternative deployment method
- `railway.json` - Railway app settings
- `server/index.ts` - Fixed server binding
- `server/db.ts` - Auto database detection

## ðŸ”§ What Happens During Build
1. Install ALL dependencies (including Vite)
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Move static files to correct location
4. Remove dev dependencies
5. Start with `npm start`

Your app should now deploy successfully to Railway without 404 errors!
