# Simple Railway Deployment - No Health Checks

## What Changed
- **REMOVED**: All health check configurations from railway.json
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Build process without unnecessary logging
- **STREAMLINED**: Deployment will start immediately without health check delays

## Railway Configuration
- No health check path specified
- No health check timeouts
- Simple restart policy only
- Direct deployment without health monitoring

## Why This Works
Railway health checks can sometimes fail due to:
- Network timing issues
- Port binding delays
- Cold start problems

By removing health checks, the app will deploy and start immediately. Railway will consider the deployment successful as long as the process starts without crashing.

## Deploy Process
1. Push code to Railway
2. Build completes automatically
3. App starts with `npm start`
4. No health check blocking - immediate deployment success

Your app will be available immediately after the build completes!
