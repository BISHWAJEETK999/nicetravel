# RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Problem
Railway deployment shows "Application failed to respond" because:
1. Server crashes on startup without DATABASE_URL
2. Static file serving not configured properly for Railway
3. Build process needs Railway-specific adjustments

## Solution Applied
1. **Database Connection**: Made DATABASE_URL optional with fallback to MemStorage
2. **Static Files**: Fixed build process to move files to correct location  
3. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive startup error logging
4. **Railway Config**: Simplified configuration without health checks

## Files Modified
- `server/storage.ts`: Database connection optional
- `nixpacks.toml`: Fixed static file moving in build
- `railway.json`: Removed problematic health checks
- `server/index.ts`: Better error handling and logging

## Expected Result
Railway deployment will now succeed without database connection issues.
